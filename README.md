> Command Line Interface for the upgradeable smart contract framework. 

HAECHI-CLI is a new Command Line Interface tool created to help developers easily develop better DApps by providing an upgradeable smart contract framework as well as new development tools.

Upgradeable Smart Contract helps to easily fix bugs and update business logics for the Dapp service.
It also provides a high-quality user experience while maintaining the same entry point for users and updating smart contracts atomically.

It helps to develop, upgrade, test, compile and control the userâ€™s current version of the Dapp service.

If you want more information about the Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework, you can take a look at the HAECHI-LABS [pdf file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xbvd3TeuOPXbMcDs-RhEFdqwxhLNXtNC/view?usp=sharing).
